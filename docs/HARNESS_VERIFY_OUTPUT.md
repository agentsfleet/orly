# CONFORM — Required output block

Runs after EXECUTE, before VERIFY. Aggregates every gate verdict; lifecycle cannot advance without enumerating the audit. Any "fail" / remaining violations → return to EXECUTE.

## Combined end-of-turn audit

`audits/msid-ui.sh` makes one awk pass over added lines. Its default
`--staged` mode reads `git diff --cached -U0`; `--diff` reads the comparison
revision through checkout HEAD (`audits/msid-ui.sh:76–85`). It emits:

- Emit `MS-ID:` hits when file is source/config and matches `M[0-9]+_[0-9]+|§[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)+|\bT[0-9]+\b|\bdim [0-9]+\.[0-9]+\b`.
- Emit `UI:` hits when under `ui/packages/app/**.{tsx,jsx}` and line contains `<(section|button|input|dialog|article|nav|header|form)\b`.

Non-empty = address before CONFORM passes. Public declarations remain subject
to the separate Public (PUB) Gate: zlint checks unused declarations, and the
agent records the shape decision (`audits/msid-ui.sh:16–33`).

## Required output

Verdict cells use ✅ pass · 🟣 n/a · 🔴 fail · 🟡 violations addressed.

Any 🔴 in the table → return to EXECUTE; the lifecycle does NOT advance.
