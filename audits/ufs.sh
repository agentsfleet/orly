# ufs.sh — enforce RULE UFS (Unified Form for Symbols) across the worktree.
#
# Dispatch façade: dispatch/write_any.md (UFS Gate)
# Fires in: make lint, CONFORM.
#
# Languages read: Zig, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, Go (see `is_source`, which
# carries the pack that owns each extension and the reasons `.py` / `.sh` are
# held out). The set is pinned against the dispatch facade by the engine
# dispatch-coverage audit — a facade that fires on a language its leaf cannot
# read is a gate that prints green over an unscanned file.
#
# Generic detection — no manifest of known literals, so the audit scales
# as the codebase grows. Three classes of violation:
#
#   1. string-dup-file   — same string literal ≥2× in one source file
#   2. numeric-suspect   — power-of-ten or unit-factor numeric not bound
#                          to a const, not on a pin-test carve-out line
#   3. cross-runtime-orphan — SCREAMING_SNAKE const defined in one runtime
#                          but missing from a sibling runtime the diff touches
#
# Carve-out: any `// pin test: literal is the contract` comment on or
# above the offending line excludes that line from numeric-suspect.
# A `const` / `pub const` / `export const` / `static` declaration line is
# likewise exempt for both per-file checks (is_const_decl + its string-dup
# mirror below) — binding the literal to a name on that line clears the hit.
# Go states the keyword once for a whole `const ( ... )` group; the string-dup
# lane tracks the group so its members are read as the declarations they are.
#
# Staged-scope semantics: --staged narrows WHICH FILES are scanned, not
# how much of each — a staged file is audited in FULL, so staging a file
# for an unrelated one-line change drags its pre-existing literal debt
# into the commit. Broad sweeps (renames touching N files) surface N
# files' latent hits at once; plan that cleanup before staging.
#
# Scope (M70):
#   Walks the full working tree via `git ls-files` — sees staged content
#   because the index is what `ls-files` reports. Pre-commit-safe: a fix
#   staged but not yet committed satisfies the check on the same hook run.
#   Deterministic negative fixtures under `evals/dispatch/fixtures/` are
#   excluded from storage scans. The dispatch evaluator copies each fixture
#   into `src/` before asserting its expected pass or failure result.
#   The previous `--diff` (BASE...HEAD) mode was retired with M70 because
#   it was blind to the index at pre-commit time.
#
# Usage:
#   ufs.sh           # full-codebase scan (default)
#   ufs.sh --all     # alias for default
#   ufs.sh --staged  # narrow per-file checks (string-dup, numeric) to
#                    # `git diff --cached`; cross-runtime parity stays full-tree
#
# Exits 0 clean, 1 on any blocking violation.

# Default: full-codebase scan (`--all` is an explicit alias). `--staged` is the
